# Hospitality-Analysis
Provided the hospitality domain's revenue team with insights

Introduction:

Across India, AtliQ Grands is the owner of several five-star hotels. They have spent the last 20 years working in the hotel sector. The strategic actions made by rivals and poor managerial decision-making are causing AtliQ Grands to lose market share and income in the luxury/business hotel segment. The managing director of AtliQ Grands intended to strategically integrate "Business and Data Intelligence" to recover their revenue and market share. They lack an internal data analytics team, therefore they are unable to get these insights.

The revenue management team decided to work with a third-party service provider to give them access to previous data insights.

Task:

Create the metrics according to the metric list.

Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
